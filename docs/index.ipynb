    "# Welcome to specsuite!\n",
    "\n",
    "```specsuite``` is a set of tools capable of loading, processing, and calibrating your spectroscopic data! As of now, it is most useful for point-source, long-slit spectrographs, but we are working on adding functionality for other types of objects and instruments!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading FITS data into arrays\n",
    "- Applying a flatfield correction\n",
    "- De-warping images using arclamp exposures\n",
    "- Extracting sky backgrounds\n",
    "- Interactively creating a wavelength calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed ```specsuite``` to be as friendly to new users while still offering robust reduction tools. Nearly every function has an optional \"debug\" argument that allows you to visually inspect the results of each step of our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each function is designed to be as modular as possible. If you only like a small subset of our tools, you can intersperse them with your own!\n",
